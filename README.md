# IOT-Enabled-Smart-Baby-Cradle-System
This project is a smart, sensor-based IoT Baby Cradle System designed to monitor a babyâ€™s environmental conditions and behavior to ensure comfort and safety. The system uses various sensors and actuators to detect conditions like motion, temperature, gas, and diaper wetness, and responds with alerts or automated cradle movement.
